.. _extension_not_available:

No Extensions Available
***********************

If there are no extensions available on the frontend, it is possible that the folder `<FAST_DATA_DIR>/extensions` is empty. To resolve this issue, try the following:

1. Click on the cloud refresh icon next to the **Applications and Workflows** title. This fetches all the chart files inside the Kaapana extension collection.

2. Wait for a minute or so. The extensions should now be visible on the webpage.
